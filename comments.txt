Definitely watch this space, as this tech will be front of mind for the next 4-5 yrs.\nFounders need to have 3 things to be successful:\nUnshakeable faith in their idea and the problem they want to tackle: If you dont believe in it, why would someone else? Your solution might need to be flexible to take on board learnings and feedback. But if you are shaky with the idea itself, its not going to be easy.Ability to inspire and attract others: If you dont get support and hire top talent, you will not be able to scale. This is often the weakness of entrepreneurs, and limits the scalability of their solutions.Know your limitations: This is the hardest one of all. The very best founders know their own limitations and get others on board to bridge the gap.\u00a0","status":"approved","type":"comment","parent":"316866","author":{"id":"165683","id_techinasia":"165683","first_name":"Hari","last_name":"Krishnan","display_name":"Hari Krishnan","description":"A seasoned GM and board director, with nearly 20yrs of industry leadership in technology &amp; digital across APAC &amp; USA.

In SE Asia, we have seen drone tech used for\u00a0videos and 360-degree photos for\u00a0instance. The future of consumer\u00a0prop tech will be determined by consumer expectations and the technology they begin to adopt. For\u00a0instance, use of virtual assistants like Amazon Echo could change how they search OR the use of AR could\u00a0change their expectations around location information. We are already seeing AR glasses on\u00a0hardhats\u00a0in construction, IoT sensors for efficient energy usage and robotics for property maintenance. Tech will fundamentally change this sector in the next decade.<\/p>\n<p>Opendoor is a fascinating solution to a well-defined problem \u2013 it takes too long for someone to sell their home and access capital in the USA. Providing this single-point solution is good because you are\u00a0fixing a real problem. Online agencies have also appeared which\u00a0fix the\u00a0problem of\u00a0high brokerages from\u00a0conventional brokers.

In SE Asia, we have seen drone tech used for\u00a0videos and 360-degree photos for\u00a0instance. The future of consumer\u00a0prop tech will be determined by consumer expectations and the technology they begin to adopt. For\u00a0instance, use of virtual assistants like Amazon Echo could change how they search OR the use of AR could\u00a0change their expectations around location information. We are already seeing AR glasses on\u00a0hardhats\u00a0in construction, IoT sensors for efficient energy usage and robotics for property maintenance. Tech will fundamentally change this sector in the next decade.\nOpendoor is a fascinating solution to a well-defined problem - it takes too long for someone to sell their home and access capital in the USA. Providing this single-point solution is good because you are\u00a0fixing a real problem. Online agencies have also appeared which\u00a0fix the\u00a0problem of\u00a0high brokerages from\u00a0conventional brokers. In both cases, they start with the problem facing the consumers, and then use\u00a0tech\u00a0to provide a solution.\nOur mission is to help people make confident property decisions through relevant content, actionable insights and world-class service.
